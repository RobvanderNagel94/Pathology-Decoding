def find_peaks_alpha_power(x_o1_closed, x_o2_closed, threshold=1.5):
    """Find peak frequencies in the estimated power spectrum.
      A combination of both "scipy.signals.find_peaks" and "scipy.signals.find_peaks_cwt"
      were used to find an initial dominant peak location before estimating the dominant frequency.
      The initial peak suggestion is based on neighboring peak frequencies. The total method comprises
      three main steps:

      Step 1) Estimate the log power spectra using Welchâ€™s method and
              detect initial peak frequencies.

      Step 2) Compute dominant peak suggestions from initial peak frequencies
              detected in both log power spectra.

      Step 3) Estimate dominant peak frequency from the estimated mean
              log power spectrum in the occipital region.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_o1_closed : numpy array
         1D array of the channel values from the o1 channel in the eyes closed state
         Input array requires common reference montage.

    x_o2_closed : numpy array
         1D array of the channel values from the o2 channel in the eyes closed state
         Input array requires common reference montage.

    threshold : float
         Parameter threshold to find neighbouring peak frequencies (e.g., pk +- threshold)

    Returns
    -------
    Qpeak : float
        dominant alpha peak frequency
